# Tea Cozy Project

This project is part of **Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path's** challenge projects.

Starting with a [*design spec*](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg) file and some images for background and content, the objective was to reproduce the website using HTML and CSS.

It was a great opportunity to practice intermediate CSS concepts like the Flexbox layout tool.
